The most common method of marking resistors is the use of a color code. This is the easiest way to place the necessary parameters on a small area. Individual colors are assigned numbers according to the table that can be seen at the link: http://www.sysrecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ResistorColorChart.png

There are usually 4 or 5 stripes on the resistor. In a four-bar marking system, the first two indicate the resistance value and the third multiplier by which to multiply the first two numbers. The fourth stripe is the acceptable tolerance. You can use a resistance calculator to get the resistance value quickly.
